##What is included?

This is the complete client side version of the codeCanvas editor. Although I am currently looking for a way to build this into a desktop application (using something like App.js, AIR or Titanium) - I just don't have the time to take it on alone.

Please contact me if you would like to build this project together :-)

##Structure

- The application codebase is located in the 'app' directory
- The user directory contains files needed to create tools (explained below)

###User directory

- usertools.html - this contains the html for the tools in your toolbox. The html construct is located inside a LI with the class "userTool". This allows you to create tool html naturally.

- usertools_design.js - This provides a the javascript for the tools while in the designer. 
- usertools_run.js - This provides the javascript your tool needs to work in a runtime environment

- usertools_design.css - This provides the styles for the tools while in the designer.  
- usertools_run.css - This provides the styles your tool needs to work in a runtime environment

##Contact

Please contact me if you would like to become a contributer to the open source code base. I would love to see this code be a part of a cross platform application and would be very interested in working with like minded devs.

If codeCanvas is useful to you, please do not hesitate to email your success stories :-)
